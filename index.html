                <h2>Why Beyoncé's Renaissance Is Culturally Monumental</h2>

                <p>Beyoncé's latest album, Rennaissance, has spawned global success and proves just how monumental and
                    influential she is 25 years into her career. The album debuted July 29, 2022, with the lead single
                    "Break My Soul" sending messages of liberation and unwavering self-expression. The album was
                    carefully
                    crafted with the LGBTQ community in mind, paying homage to some of our most significant influences,
                    dead and
                    alive.
